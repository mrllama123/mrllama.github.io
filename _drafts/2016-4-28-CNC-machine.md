So i finally  decided to use my ardino for somthing usefull and i knew i had some
old cd drives around the place so i decided to build an cnc machine, which is
somthing i have wanted to do for ages. this guide [here]() is what gave me the inspriration

So far i have token apart the cd drives which i will use the stepper motors (which controll
  the movement of the lazer) to controll the x and y axis i am still not sure what i will  
do for the z axis. I could eaither use an lazer of use an servo motor and palce an pen
on the servo.

I also have done the soldering aspect of it as well, so creating the wires for the stepper
motors and soldering them to the motor pins, which was terrible soldering but hey it does the job.    
Then i had to buy an stepper motor controller so i could actually controll the motors which i have yet to test
