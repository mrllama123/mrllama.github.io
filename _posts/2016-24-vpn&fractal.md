So i have been doing quite alot recently, I created an vpn using my droplet on digital
 ocean (which has been lying there doing nothing for ages) in the spand of four hours
which was pretty simple all it took was to download the deb file from the open vpn site
 and then create a open ip adress (so you can connect with the server) and it works fairly well
 the only issue is i'm in new zealnd and i'm on a asdl 2 connection so its quite slow but thats
 the servers fault.

 I also have finally finished my Sierpinski triangle fractal, In the end i ended up using
 the paper js libary because for some reason it felt better to use that processing and looks great
 the next thing i want to do is make the tringle scale up and down depending on the canvas width and height.

Lastly i added an perfolio page on this website the showcase some of the work i'm doing which i based it
off an template that i saw online.
