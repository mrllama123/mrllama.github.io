its been a busy week (but great) for me but i have spent some time figuring out
what this blog is for. Which is basically going to document my projects (which i will talk
 about) and any interesting ideas that i have(which is many).

currently there is two projects i want to work on, one is actually using my raspberry pi for something... most likely i will setup it as a music streaming device using [cherry music](http://www.fomori.org/cherrymusic/) which  is a simple python server (there is a [guide](http://fomori.org/blog/?p=687) to get it setup on the pi) the only reason i have not set this up is because there is no Ethernet connectors in the house  (and i have the pi b+ so no wireless I do have a wireless dongle but its crap) also the router is in my flatmate's study and that is kind of awkward for me to place my pi in there. So i have bought a wireless dongle from aliexpress which says its ["raspberry pi supported"](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mini-Raspberry-Pi-WiFi-Adapter-150Mbps-USB-WiFi-Adapter-For-Raspberry-Pi-A-Raspberry-Pi-B/32506486116.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_6,searchweb201602_2_10017_10005_10006_10034_10021_507_10022_508_10020_10018_10019,searchweb201603_6&btsid=aef8486b-66df-4a03-ad87-03bd84759eea) so we will see how that turns out and hey i only spent 8 bucks so i can't really complain.

The other project is going to be creating repetitive shapes using JavaScript (i.e fractals). Ever since i was a teenager i have been interested in fractals the fact that with one mathematical equation can form amazing and appearing random shapes fascinates me and they look awesome :smile:. I'm not sure how exactly i am going to implement this but there is some great shape vector libraries that people have created in JavaScript (i have been playing with [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)) so it will make it fairly easy to implement the hard part is understanding the algorithms but i think its a challenge i can do.
