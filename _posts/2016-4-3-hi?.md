title: Finally got running!

So i finally got this damn site to work :smile:. It always seems to take longer than it should when ever
i try and setup anything like this. I always seem to do something that goes against the simple instructions
and fucks everything up But hey at least i have it setup now (even if it took me most of the when i was supposed to do assignments....).

anyway I'm not sure exactly what i am going to do with this site but knowing me i will figure something out.
