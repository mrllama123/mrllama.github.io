one work can describe how its been for me this last week busy. Yeah that's what happens when you leave assignments
a little too late..

Anyway because of that i haven't had much time to my side projects and my wireless dongle hasn't came
as well which sucks but i have had some ideas on how to tackle the fractal algorithm, which is to
write it in the processing language because it is really easy to move in over to JavaScript using the [p5js](http://p5js.org/) library which would make it easy to implement it on my website.I was thinking of implementing the Sierpinski triangle and then creating my own fractal algorithm which will randomly generate lines connected to each other which is what i do when i doodle.

I also learned what agile was today though the internship program I'm doing. which sounds really cool and is very much up my alley because it has a strong emphases of small teams and one to one communication which is how i work as a programmer. So i will defiantly do some research on it.
