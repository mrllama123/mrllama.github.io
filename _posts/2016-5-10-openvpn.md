recently i have been very busy with school work so i havent had time to do much
and on top of that i have had allot of assaments all due at the same time so
fun times...

but what have been doing is playing with the digital ocean droplet and getting some better
understanding of server administration. So a while back i installed an open vpn server on this
droplet(using this great [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-14-04))
Which long story short didn't really work there were two problems: there was an dns leak (which was my laptops fault
  i think) and i would have trouble connecting to the server becuase for some reason the
  authentication keys and certificate were wrong (which was strange becuase a day before they were working perfectly...) oh and the server is in the us so latancy was fun :smile: . what i have ended up doing is
  finding a installer [script](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install) which works great except im still getting dns
  leaks which is not the servers fault i think.
